# Welcome to Zichao and Yuheng's project



## Basic idea

Electromagnetic wave's speed and amplitude will decrease to different level when it travel in different material. We may use this property the identificate different liquid solution.

WiFi signal is one of the most common electromagnetic wave in our lives. It's easy to get some off-the-shelf WiFi signal generater. In this project, we use ESP32 which is about $10 each.
